// Business Model layer, in this instance you can manage your business logic. For example,
// if you want to create a pet before creating a person, because you'll end up adding that
// pet to the person, this is the place.

// In libraries/model you have the basic support for RESTful methods. Because this class
// is extending from there, you got that solved.
// You can overwrite extended methods or create custom ones here. Also you can support
// more mongoose functionality like skip, sort etc.
